# MS-Word-Table-Merge-Program-Word-Automation-
I designed a tkinter based windows app to merge tables from three individual MS word files to a single large table in a MS word file. This word automation project was performed when i was working as a technical writer in a company. And this has saved a lot of my time and energy while working there after automating the tedious and difficult task of copying large contents. from different files to single one. I thought of selling this software to the company but never made an offer may be due to my poor "Salesmanship".  Thanks to my little knowledge of data structure and algorithm and python programming, i have saved a heck of my mental energy.
What i have done in this project:
1. I designed the basic UI for the project using Tkinter (When i say basic it means very basic:))
2. I used by little broken knowledge of Python DSA and devised an algorithm.(It sounds easier but trust me it took about 10 days of my 1 liesure hours per day)
3. I utilized python-docx library to do all the word processing and related operations.
4. I tested it and used it so happiliy and proudly.
